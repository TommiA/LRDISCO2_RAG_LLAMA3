This is a short trial of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method with a quantized version of the LLAMA 3 8B Large Language Model. The retrieval is performed using the Chroma vector database, which stores parts of the document and their respective embeddings from the Land Rover Discovery II maintenance manual (not included in this repository).
